# Advanced Git Features

---

## Tagging and release management

- A tag is a way to mark a specific commit as a release.
- You can create tags by typing `git tag <tag_name>` in the terminal/command prompt.
- You can push tags to remote repository by typing `git push --tags` in the terminal/command prompt.
- A release can be thought of as a snapshot of the software product at a specific point in time and is usually tagged with a version number.
- **GitHub allows you to manage tags and releases through the web interface.**

---

## Stashing changes

- Stashing allows you to save changes that you are currently working on, but don't want to commit yet to your branch. This can be useful if you need to switch between branches.
- You can create a stash by typing `git stash` in the terminal/command prompt.
- You can apply the stash by typing `git stash apply` in the terminal/command prompt.

---

## Reverting changes

- Reverting allows you to undo changes that were made to a file, a commit or a range of commits.
- You can revert changes by typing `git revert <commit_hash>` in the terminal/command prompt.

---

## Advanced merging and resolving conflicts

- Advanced merging strategies include:
  - `git merge --no-ff`: This command creates a new commit even if the merge could be fast-forwarded.
  - `git merge --squash`: This command merges the changes but squash them into a single commit.
- You can use `git mergetool` command to resolve conflicts with a visual tool.
- **VS Code and GitHub Desktop have built-in support for dealing with merge conflicts.**

## Exercise [15 minutes]

- Create a release against `main` for your repository using the GitHub web interface. Use the tag `v0.1` and write a short description with bullet points of the exercises completed so far.
- Discuss as a group why releases would be useful for publishing software.

*Tip:*

```bash
Releases -> Create a new release
```
