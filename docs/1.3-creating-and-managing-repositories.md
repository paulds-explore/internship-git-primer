# Creating and Managing Repositories

---

## Creating a new repository on Github

- Click on the `+` button on the top right corner and select `New repository`.
- Fill in the required information (repository name, description, etc) and select the options you prefer
- Click on the `Create repository` button.

---

## Cloning a repository to your local machine

- Go to the repository on Github that you want to clone
- Click on the `Code` button and copy the HTTPS link.
- Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Type `git clone <repository_link>` and press enter.
- This will download a copy of the repository to your local machine.

## Basic Git commands

- **git add**: Adds changes to the staging area.
- **git commit**: Takes the changes from the staging area and saves them to the local repository with a message.
- **git push**: Pushes the changes from the local repository to the remote repository on Github.
- **git pull**: Pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local repository.

## Working directory vs staging area vs local repository

- **Working directory**: The place where you make changes to the files.
- **Staging area**: The place where you prepare your changes to be committed.
- **Local repository**: The place where you keep a history of your commits, it's stored on your local machine.
