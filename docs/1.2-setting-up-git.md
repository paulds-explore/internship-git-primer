# Setting up Git

---

## Installing Git on your computer

- Git is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- You can download the latest version from the official website: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Follow the instructions for your specific operating system to complete the installation.
- To check if Git is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type `git --version`. This should display the version of Git you have installed. If you installed Git on Windows and didn't modify the PATH environment variable, you may need to use **Git Bash** for this.

## Creating a Github account

- Go to <https://github.com/> and sign up for a new account.
- Fill in the required information and select a plan (Free is fine for most use cases).
- Verify your email address.

---

## Connecting your local Git installation to Github

- In your terminal/command prompt, type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and press enter.
- Type `git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"` and press enter.
- This name and email address will be used as the default for all your commits.
- Use `git config --list` to see the full configuration.

## Tools to make your life easier

- There are various tools that make working with Git significantly simpler, these include standalone tools like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). IDEs like VS Code come with built-in support for working with Git and can be enhanced further with extensions such as the [Git Graph Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph).
