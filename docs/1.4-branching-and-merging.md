# Branching and Merging

---

## Explanation of branches

- A branch is a separate copy of the project that allows you to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main version of the project.
- You can create, switch, and merge branches as needed.
- The default branch is usually called `main`.

---

## Creating and switching between branches

- To create a new branch, type `git branch <branch_name>` in the terminal/command prompt.
- To switch to a different branch, type `git checkout <branch_name>` in the terminal/command prompt.
- To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, type `git checkout -b <branch_name>` in the terminal/command prompt.

---

## Merging branches and resolving conflicts

- To merge a branch into the current branch, type `git merge <branch_name>` in the terminal/command prompt.
- If there are conflicts between the branches, Git will prompt you to resolve them before the merge.
- You can use `git diff` to see the differences between the branches and `git add` and `git commit` to resolve the conflicts.

## Exercise I [10 minutes]

- Remember, you can use the command line, GitHub Desktop or Git Graph in VS Code. Using the repository you created previously, create two branches called `hello` and `goodbye` locally.
- Checkout the branch called `hello`.
- Add a file called `greetings.py` with the following lines:

  ```python
  name = input("What is your name? ")
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  ```

- Stage and commit the file to the `hello` branch.
- Merge the changes into `main` and delete the `hello` branch.

---

## Exercise II [15 minutes]

- Checkout the `goodbye` branch.
- Add a file called `greetings.py` with the following lines:

  ```python
  name = input("What is your name? ")
  print(f"Goodbye, {name}!") # NOTE: it says "Goodbye" here
  ```

- Commit your changes and try merge this branch into `main`, this should result in a merge conflict.
- Resolve the conflict by **accepting the incoming change**.
- Stage and merge the changes into `main`.
- Delete the `goodbye` branch.

---

### Exercise III [10 minutes]

- Sync your main branch to the remote repository.
- Discuss as a group any challenges you faced with this exercise.
- Why was there a conflict? Is there a way this could have been avoided?
- As a group are you now comfortable with:
  - working with branches?
  - resolving conflicts?
