# Collaboration on Github

---

## Understanding Github's pull request workflow

- Pull requests are a way to propose changes to a project and have them reviewed and merged by the repository owner or collaborators.
- To create a pull request, you need to have your changes on a separate branch and make a request to merge that branch into (usually) the `main` branch.
- The repository owner or collaborators can review the changes, discuss them, and approve or request changes before merging.

---

## Collaborating on a project with multiple people

- Each person can clone the repository to their local machine, make changes, and push them to a separate branch.
- Then each person can create a pull request to merge their branch into the main branch.
- The repository owner or collaborators can review the changes and merge them.
- It's a good idea to regularly `merge` or `rebase` the `main` branch into your working feature branch to ensure you always have the most recent changes.

## Managing permissions and access to a repository

- The repository owner can give access to other users by adding them as collaborators.
- Collaborators can have different levels of access (read, write, admin).
- The repository owner can also set up teams and give them access to specific repositories.

## Understanding the concept of "remotes"

- A remote is a connection to a remote repository on Github.
- By default, the remote repository is called `origin`.
- You can see the list of remotes by typing `git remote -v` in the terminal/command prompt.

## Exercise I [10 minutes]

- For this exercise you will work in pairs, the facilitator for your group will assign the pairings.
- In each pair, add the other participant as a collaborator to your `git-primer` repo with the "Write" role. You'll need to know your partner's GitHub username.
- Check your email to accept the invitation.

*Tip:*

```ascii
Repo -> Settings -> Access -> Collaborators & teams -> Invite a collaborator
```

## Exercise II [10 minutes]

- Clone your partner's repo to your local machine.
- Create a branch called `working-together` and check it out.
- Edit `greetings.py` as follows:

```python
from datetime import datetime

name = input("What is your name? ")
hour = datetime.now().time().hour
greeting = "Good morning" if 4 <= hour < 12 else "Good afternoon" if 12 <= hour < 16 else "Good night"
print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")
```

---

## Exercise III [10 minutes]

- Commit your changes and publish your branch.
- Go to your partner's repo in GitHub, click `Pull requests -> New pull request`
- Make sure the `working-together` branch is under "compare" and the base is "main".
- Familiarise yourself with the available inputs. Add a description of your changes and assign the owner of the repo as a reviewer.
- Open the pull request to ask that your changes are merged into `main`.

---

## Exercise IV [10 minutes]

- The owner of the repo must now go to the "Pull requests" tab and check the proposed changes - review the diff under "Files changed".
- If everything is 100% to the owner's liking, they should leave a comment that they are happy with the changes and merge the pull request.
- Delete the source branch from the remote repository once merged.

---

## Exercise V [15 minutes]

- Discuss as a group what you have just worked through.
- Is everyone comfortable with:
  - adding collaborators to a repo?
  - working on a branch to prepare a pull request?
  - reviewing and merging a pull request?
